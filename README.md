# Better Dark Mode Theme

A minimalist, high-contrast Chrome theme specifically designed to match the YouTube Dark Mode and other deep-dark web interfaces.

## Visual Optimization Note

For the best visual results, it is recommended to use this theme on a monitor with **HDR (High Dynamic Range)** enabled. This ensures the deepest black levels and a smooth transition between the browser UI and high-quality video content, providing a truly immersive dark mode experience.

## Theme Overview

* **Seamless UI:** The frame and toolbar colors are perfectly matched to eliminate the box effect around the window control buttons.
* **Authentic Dark Mode:** Uses the specific dark tones required to blend perfectly with the YouTube background and other dark-themed websites.
* **Enhanced Readability:** Focused on high-contrast text and icons to reduce eye strain and improve accessibility.
